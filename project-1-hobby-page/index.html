          <h3>Who is <span>Light Yagami</span>? A <em>light </em>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            In this web page I'll be analysing the protagonist/anti-hero of the
            Anime series, <em>Death Note.</em> Light Yagami was a honourary
            student ranking top of all his classes in Japan and son to a member
            of the Japanese Task Force. In the year 2006, he found the
            mysterious "Death Note" which appeared out of no where - a book that
            claimed to take the life of anyone who's name is written.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only is he academically smart, but also shows himself to be
            highly perceptive with a set of amazing problem solving skills - he
            was praised and respected highly amongst his family and peers which
            laid the foundation for an intense game of Cat and Mouse with Law
            Inforcement.
