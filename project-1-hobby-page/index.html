            In this web page, I'll be analysing the protagonist/anti-hero of the
            Anime series, Death Note. Light Yagami was an honourary student
            ranked top of all his classes in Tokyo, Japan and the son of a
            member of the Japanese Task Force. In the year 2006, he found the
            mysterious "Death Note" - a book that claimed to take the life of
            anyone whose name is written - which fell from the sky by a "death
            God" known as "Ryuk".
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only is he academically gifted, but also shows himself to be
            highly perceptive with a set of amazing problem-solving skills - he
            was praised and respected highly amongst his family and peers which
            laid the foundation for an intense game of Cat and Mouse with the
            Japanese Law Enforcement.
          </p>
          <p>
            He will later be referred to as Kira (<a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kira_(given_name)"
              ><em>Killer</em></a
            >) or Kami (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami"
              ><em>God</em></a
            >
            ) - a testament to the difference in perception between the public
            and the Law Enforcement as well as showing the viewer/reader how
            Light himself perceived his own character. I will be exploring both
            of these names to describe his sense of justice and how the
            consequences of his actions align with how "justice" is portrayed in
            the Anime Series.

        <h3 class="subheader">What is the Death Note?</h3>
        <div class="justice-content">
          <p>
            Before discussing the mindset of Light, we first have to define what
            the Death Note is. The Death Note is a book created in another world
            by Shinigami (Gods), these Shinigami feed off of the souls of human
            beings. The black book of Death was written by a Shinigami named
            "Ryuk" (meaning 'boring' or 'boredom' in Japanese) before dropping
            the book into the human world. The book we see Light using is
            actually a second Death Note which Ryuk wrote rules into for humans
            to understand - his motivations for this? Well, it's all in the
            meaning of his name; pure boredom which speaks volumes to the
            sadistic nature of the book itself, the owner and those who
            eventually end up using it. Who said death is another part of life?
            - not this Shinigami.

          <h3 class="subheader">The first encounter</h3>
          <p>
            Light first encounters the Death Note while in a class he notices an
            object flying from the sky, we also glimpse into his character
            during this moment - him being the only one to notice the object,
            they also show his intellectual prowess by suddenly snapping out his
            trance of wondering what the object was and answering his teacher's
            question which as the viewer/reader do not know what is being asked.
            After his class, he picks the book up and shrugs it off as some sort
            of sick joke, but curiosity gets the better of him.
          </p>
          <p>
            A book that kills people by writing their name down with a mental
            image of the person in mind sounds absurd, it defies all logic - so
            what's the harm in using it? It's not as if it'll actually work is
            it? If he is going to use it, who would be the best person to test
            it on? The world of Death Note is similar to our reality, it's
            filled with both good and evil, but the Death Note setting is a
            world where there's more evil than good - there isn't enough
            justice, murderers serve small time, judges are paid off, media
            hosts scam the public with lies for profit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Light believed he was the example of the perfect person. He was
            polite, highly intelligent, emotionally aware and treated in high
            regard by the majority, however, had a strong disdain for those who
            committed heinous acts against the innocent; if only someone had the
            power to do something about it, to have the courage to step forth,
            have the right amount of intellect to deal with these situations. In
            the world of Death Note, this is apparent in the opening scene where
            we see a major rise in crime on the billboard - this created his
            sense of justice and he now has the potential means to carry it out.

                  In this section of the manga, we see Light's amazing
                  intellectual prowess in action, despite the idea of using a
                  book to take a life, he meticulously considers the
                  circumstances on the off chance that this book actually does
                  as it suggests; “I need to be able to know if they immediately
                  died…”, “It should be someone not connected to me… someone
                  whose death doesn't matter” - at this point in time he still
                  holds onto his humanity by later coming to question why he is
                  even taking this serious.

                  During his train of thought, a program is interrupted by the
                  breaking news of a hostage situation taking place at a
                  preschool with a teacher and 7 children - the man in question
                  is a 42 years old unemployed man with a track record of 6
                  kills to his name - immediately this answered Light's question
                  and he wrote his name down… 40 seconds passed by… no death…
                  but to his surprise the hostages were suddenly leaving the
                  building and it was reported that the suspect died of a heart
                  attack.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As we already know, Light is very intelligent with a radical
                  sense of justice, one test is not enough - it could've been a
                  coincidence, the suspects said he suddenly collapsed. It was
                  at this moment that he appointed himself the responsibility of
                  “cleansing the world” - he doesn't question the morality of
                  taking another human's life but questions the validity of his
                  test - if he could find another test subject this will be a
                  win for him… no, for the world. To him, this man was nothing
                  more than just scum of the earth who deserved to die and so he
                  set out to find another.

                  Light's confirmaiton of the Death Note's power comes from his
                  next victim, a fellow classmate, 'Shibutaku'. Shubutaku is
                  your typical high school bully in visual media during the
                  2000s - arrogant, abusive by nature and looks over 30 for some
                  reason. We see Shibutaku in class with his friends bullying
                  another classmate, Light acknowledges it and debates whether
                  or not to kill him. He asks himself if it should be someone
                  close to him to avoid trouble but mainly because he still has
                  some of his humanity left - he questions their malicious ways
                  and if the world would really be a better place without them.

                <p>
                  On his way home, he decides to stop at a local gas station to
                  get some snacks before "studying", the bullies are also there
                  causing trouble, Shibutaku sees a young lady and prompts her
                  to go out with him despite her saying no repeatedly - who will
                  stop them? Well here's the perfect test sample, who will care
                  if these pieces of filth are removed from the earth? And so he
                  uses it - after 40 seconds, a truck strikes down Shibuktaku.

            Light meets Ryuk after discovering the power of the death note, his
            first appearance is in alliance with the book - a subtle yet dark
            presence. As any person would, Light is startled by his appearance -
            a tall dark demonic figure with red pupils who can only be seen by
            those who've touched the book before. Ryuk chillingly informs Light
            that since he has used the book as a consequence he will inevitably
            die by his own hands and is not sent to either Heaven or Hell for
            being a human user. To Ryuk's surprise, Light had already accepted
            death and wanted to ask him questions about using the book. Light
            treats his role as some sort of chosen being who will become a
            martyr once he's “cleansed” the earth of its evil. Ryuk funnily
            retorts by telling Light he only dropped the book because he was
            bored.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this moment we get a glimpse into the God's complex shown through
            Light. After being informed that he only found the book by chance,
            he laughs hysterically, Ryuk confused by his reaction asks him why
            he even wants to become the God of Earth and points out the number
            of names he's already written, Light replies “Because I'm also
            bored”. A God stands above all and in this case, Light even wants to
            be beyond the creator of the book itself by not allowing Ryuk to
            demean his vision as a variant of luck or chance - it is fate - and
            by fate, he claims that the book belongs to Earth itself because
            it's landed here now.

                represents the opposition to Light's philosophy of cleansing the
                world - he is also very intelligent and experienced with
                high-profile investigations that the Japanese government cannot
                handle. He is such an asset to the task force that no one has
                ever seen his face before, instead, he communicates through his
                right-hand man, Watari. L differs in personality however coming
                across as an antisocial weirdo with childish tendencies but it's
                not until we see his first appearance that we find out his true
                prowess.

            With a number of seemingly “natural” deaths happening in Japan, the
            task force could not figure out a way to find out why or who is
            performing these murders so they resort to calling L to investigate.

          <p>
            Finally, the Cat and Mouse chase begins with L making his debut in
            the case by demonstrating his experience and intellect. He instructs
            Watari to have a fake “L” make an appearance on television claiming
            he will take down this vigilante once and for all to which Light
            responds by promptly writing the person's name down and he dies
            after 40 seconds… without any hesitation, L's signature appears on
            the screen informing the killer that this was a fake and performs
            incredible speculation on a potential lead by deducing the events of
            the recent murders and what's just happened:

                weekdays between 11:00 - 02:00. This is reflected through his
                conversation with his father (detective in the kira case) over
                dinner.
