            In this web page I'll be analysing the protagonist/anti-hero of the
            Anime series, <em>Death Note.</em> Light Yagami was a honourary
            student ranking top of all his classes in Japan and son to a member
            of the Japanese Task Force. In the year 2006, he found the
            mysterious "Death Note" which appeared out of no where - a book that
            claimed to take the life of anyone who's name is written.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only is he academically gifted, but also shows himself to be
            highly perceptive with a set of amazing problem solving skills - he
            was praised and respected highly amongst his family and peers which
            laid the foundation for an intense game of Cat and Mouse with the
            Japanese Law Inforcement.
          </p>
          <p>
            He will later be reffered to as Kira (<a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kira_(given_name)"
              ><em>Killer</em></a
            >) or Kami (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami"
              ><em>God</em></a
            >
            ) - a testament to the difference of perception between the public
            and the Law Inforcement as well as showing the viewer/reader how
            Light himself perceived his own character. I will be exploring both
            of these names to describe his sense of justice and how the
            consequences of these actions align with how "justice" is portrayed
            in the Anime Series.
